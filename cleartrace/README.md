# Overview

This directory contains a jupyter notebook and input datasets needed to run the notebook and intermediate data produced as a part of the exploratory data analysis.

Data includes hourly energy used at three facilities over several months, corresponding gas and water used for each of those months, and the grid mix for the area the facilities reside within.

The objective of the interview was to put together a customer-facing report to understand Scope 2 Emissions.

Questions that came up and initial findings from the EDA are in a Google Doc [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18EwoPV-sZPEPzxZHNZQV0uCBxJDyxTrQiHDfnizTYlc/edit#heading=h.mc6xea1k08fv)
