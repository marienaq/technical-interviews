# Overivew

This is an example of solution code for a technical challenge I created for Daybreak Health for hiring an Analytics Engineer with data modeling skills.

Instructions for the technical challenge were provided to the candidate separately and are in a private Google Doc.

The grading rubric is also in a private Google doc.

If you are interested in hiring me to build out a similar dbt-based interview challenge that provides a problem similar to real-world data modeling problems an Analytics Engineer working with BigData will encounter, email me - mariena@mellonhead.co
